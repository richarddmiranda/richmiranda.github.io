I'm Rich, a growth and product marketing consultant. I work with start-ups and small businesses, helping them find customers and stand out in crowded, competitive markets. Before that, I spent over 10 years working with start-ups in various Growth Marketing roles in London and Berlin. Then I had a kid and took most of 2023 off to hang out with her.

I'm a Brit who grew up in the States with a Spanish dad living in Berlin, Germany. It's complicated.

In my spare time, I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (and have done for the last 15 years), read a lot, and waste way too much time on the internet.

## Working on:

- **Growth Craft** - my Growth Marketing consultancy.
- **Marketing Strategy Breakdowns** - my marketing newsletter.

## Learning:

- **German** - Stalled my progress out for a long time at B1 after having my daughter. Finally, picking things up again.

## Reading:

- **The First Law series by Joe Abercrombie** - It’s been probably over a decade since I read a fantasy book, but these are fantastic and I’m all in. Seven down, two to go!
- **The Family Firm by Emily Oster** - Only just begun, but her parenting-focused books are all really good.
