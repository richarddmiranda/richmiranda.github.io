I'm Rich, a Growth and Product Marketing consultant. I help companies define who their target audience is and then figure out how to turn them into customers. Before going into consulting, I spent over 10 years working with start-ups in various senior Growth Marketing roles in London and Berlin. 

I had a baby gurl in 2023 and took most of the year off to hang out with her. It was equal parts amazing and tough.

I'm a Brit who grew up in the US with a Spanish dad currently living in Berlin, Germany. It's complicated.

In my spare time, I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (and have done for the last 15 years), read a lot, and waste way too much time on the internet.

## Working on:

- **Growth Craft** - my Growth Marketing consultancy.
- **Marketing Strategy Breakdowns** - my marketing newsletter.

## Learning:

- **German** - Well, I live in Germany. Stalled my progress out for a long time after having my daughter. But finally, back at it.

## Reading:

- **The First Law series by Joe Abercrombie** - It’s been probably over a decade since I read a fantasy book, but these are fantastic and I’m all in. Think I've read nine...?
- **The Family Firm by Emily Oster** - The GOAT parent book author. This ones not as good as Expecting Better, but still interesting.
